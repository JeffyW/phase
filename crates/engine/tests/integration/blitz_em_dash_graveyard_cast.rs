//! CR 702.152 Blitz — em-dash (compound) blitz costs cast from the graveyard.
//!
//! Covers the complete em-dash blitz class, which is exactly two cards:
//!   * Sabin, Master Monk   — "Blitz—{2}{R}{R}, Discard a card."
//!   * Tenacious Underdog   — "Blitz—{2}{B}{B}, Pay 2 life."
//!
//! Both also carry "You may cast this card from your graveyard using its blitz
//! ability.", so the graveyard route is the only route that matters for them.
//!
//! CR 702.152a: "Blitz [cost]" means "You may cast this card by paying [cost]
//! rather than its mana cost". CR 118.9 governs the alternative cost, and
//! CR 601.2h governs paying the non-mana residual (discard / pay life) as part
//! of the total cost.
//!
//! These tests drive the real parser output into a scenario, so they exercise
//! parser -> keyword extraction -> casting-variant selection -> cost payment.
